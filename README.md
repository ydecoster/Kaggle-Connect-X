# Kaggle-Connect-X

The Challenge

In this game, your objective is to get a certain number of your checkers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the game board before your opponent. When it's your turn, you “drop” one of your checkers into one of the columns at the top of the board. Then, let your opponent take their turn. This means each move may be trying to either win for you, or trying to stop your opponent from winning. The default number is four-in-a-row, but we’ll have other options to come soon.

Background History

For the past 10 years, our competitions have been mostly focused on supervised machine learning. The field has grown, and we want to continue to provide the data science community cutting-edge opportunities to challenge themselves and grow their skills.

So, what’s next? Reinforcement learning is clearly a crucial piece in the next wave of data science learning. We hope that Simulation Competitions will provide the opportunity for Kagglers to practice and hone this burgeoning skill.
